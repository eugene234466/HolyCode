# ✦ HolyCode

> Scripture written as code. Daily devotionals and coding challenges for developers of faith.

HolyCode is a community platform where Bible verses are interpreted as actual code or pseudocode. Every day, a new devotional drops automatically and a new challenge invites developers (and non-developers) to write their own interpretation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holycode.git
cd holycode
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/postgres
BIBLE_API_URL=https://beta.ourmanna.com/api/v1/get/?format=json&order=verse
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_vapid_private_key
VAPID_EMAIL=mailto:your@email.com
```

### 4. Generate VAPID keys (for push notifications)

```bash
python -m py_webpush generate_vapid_keys
```

### 5. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000`

## 📖 How It Works

```
Every day at midnight:
  1. OurManna API → fetches verse of the day
  2. Groq → writes a code snippet devotional from the verse
  3. Groq → independently picks a challenge verse + writes prompt
  4. Both are saved to the database
  5. Push notifications sent to subscribers

Users:
  1. Visit the site → see today's devotional + challenge
  2. Submit their own code or pseudocode interpretation
  3. Like other submissions
  4. Click "Learn This Concept" → Groq explains the programming concept
  5. Download code card or generate AI image
```
